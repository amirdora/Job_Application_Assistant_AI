# Xing Job Application AI Assistant

The **Xing Job Application AI Assistant** automates job applications on the Xing platform based on user-defined preferences. This AI Assistant allows users to log in manually (without sharing credentials), specify job types, locations, and remote/onsite preferences in a configuration file, and captures session cookies to perform headless applications.

## Features

- **Manual Login**: Users log in manually without sharing credentials.
- **Headless Automation**: The AI Assistant uses headless mode to apply for jobs automatically based on user preferences.
- **Configurable Preferences**: Job search preferences are stored in a configuration file (`config.yaml`).
- **Logging**: All application processes and outcomes are logged for easy reference.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Verify by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your command line.
2. **Pip**: Pip should be installed with Python. Verify by running `pip --version`.
3. **Chrome Browser**: The AI Assistant uses Chrome for automation. [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if it's not installed.

## Installation

### Windows Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirdora/Auto_Jobs_Applier_AI.git
   cd xing-job-application-AI Assistant
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Requirements in the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### macOS Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xing-job-application-AI Assistant.git
   cd xing-job-application-AI Assistant
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Requirements in the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create a `config.yaml` File**: Set up job preferences in `config.yaml` to specify job type, location, remote preference, and logging file path.

Example `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   # config.yaml

   job_preferences:
     job_type: "Developer"         # Job title to search for
     location: "Frankfurt"         # Job location
     remote: "yes"                 # Options: "yes" for remote, "no" for on-site
     city_id: "2925533.36f095"     # City ID for Frankfurt, change based on target location

   logging:
     log_file: "application_log.txt"   # Path for log file
   ```
   Update `job_type`, `location`, `remote`, and `city_id` to match your preferences. The `log_file` specifies where application logs are stored.

## Usage

1. **Run the AI Assistant**:

   With the virtual environment activated, run the main script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Login**:

   A window will prompt you to log in to Xing manually. Use the Chrome browser window to complete the login.
   Close the prompt once logged in; the AI Assistant will capture cookies and proceed with the headless application process.

3. **Monitor Logs**:

   All actions are logged in `application_log.txt`. Open this file to track which jobs have been applied to, along with timestamps and any errors encountered.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **ChromeDriver Compatibility**:

  If you encounter ChromeDriver issues, make sure that AI Assistanth Chrome and ChromeDriver are updated. If issues persist, specify the ChromeDriver version in `requirements.txt` and reinstall:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Login Issues**:

  Ensure that you complete the login manually. The AI Assistant waits for the login process but will timeout if login takes too long. Restart the script if this occurs.

- **Permission Errors on macOS**:

  If you encounter permission issues on macOS, grant execution permissions to ChromeDriver:
  ```bash
  chmod +x venv/bin/chromedriver
  ```

- **Session Cookie Issues**:

  If the AI Assistant doesn’t seem to remember the login, ensure cookies are correctly saved in the initial session. Restart the AI Assistant if needed.

- **Application Logs**:

  Review `application_log.txt` to troubleshoot failed applications. Errors are logged with timestamps to assist in debugging.

This setup ensures a secure and reliable experience for automating job applications on Xing. Adjust configuration options as needed and refer to the logs for a complete record of all applied jobs and any encountered issues.
